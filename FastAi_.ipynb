       "xxbos i did n't see this movie when it originally came out , but there has been a couple songs sharing the title and the term still gets used from time to time and i figured there must be something to the flick , so i dug it up and gave a view . xxmaj now i would like the approximate hour and forty five minutes of my life xxunk seemed much longer ) . xxmaj there was nothing particularly bad about the movie , the acting was good , no large plot holes , of course there was n't much plot to have holes in . xxmaj there just was n't a lot to the movie . xxmaj there was some chemistry between the two but nothing compelling about their relationship ; xxmaj nothing interesting about their story . xxmaj near the end when he attempts to chase down the train to catch his fleeing romance , neither my wife nor i wanted him to catch her . xxmaj honestly we figured they were better off with out each other and if they did get back together we really did n't care . xxmaj so what 's that say about this love story when even a 25 year old sappy romantic like my wife had no emotional investment in the relationship . i should have left this one in the \" missed \" category . xxmaj logan xxmaj xxunk xxunk / xxunk,xxbos yes it 's xxmaj zakk . yes it 's a masterpiece . why ? well , where does one start ? xxmaj zakk xxmaj wylde decided that his xxmaj ozzy xxmaj days were n't really what he was about . undoubtedly he owes his rock and roll life to the xxmaj xxunk , but he felt there was something more to share with the world . this is what he put forth . a true master work from a man who may be the rock and roll high priest of our generation . everthing that is great about rock is found within : blues , country , a little bit of soulful harmony and good old fashioned heavy metal will grace your eardrums on this gem . why try to describe each tune , when you can let the music do the talking . i bought this baby the day it was released , and have never had a single week go by when i did n't hear a track from it , be it from a mix cd , or the cd itself . do yourself a huge favor and pick it up while you 're on here . too much talk can spoil the surprise . just trust me and spin it for yourself . peace .,xxbos i was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film . xxmaj if you sit close to the screen , you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures . xxmaj the detail , colors , and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than xxmaj toy xxmaj story . xxmaj how they were able to pull off the shading , i will never know . i do hope that xxup pixar will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so i can find out how all this was accomplished . xxmaj based on this film , i think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film .,xxbos xxmaj pretty good service for fast food .,xxbos xxmaj works great .\n",

       "xxbos i did n't see this movie when it originally came out , but there has been a couple songs sharing the title and the term still gets used from time to time and i figured there must be something to the flick , so i dug it up and gave a view . xxmaj now i would like the approximate hour and forty five minutes of my life xxunk seemed much longer ) . xxmaj there was nothing particularly bad about the movie , the acting was good , no large plot holes , of course there was n't much plot to have holes in . xxmaj there just was n't a lot to the movie . xxmaj there was some chemistry between the two but nothing compelling about their relationship ; xxmaj nothing interesting about their story . xxmaj near the end when he attempts to chase down the train to catch his fleeing romance , neither my wife nor i wanted him to catch her . xxmaj honestly we figured they were better off with out each other and if they did get back together we really did n't care . xxmaj so what 's that say about this love story when even a 25 year old sappy romantic like my wife had no emotional investment in the relationship . i should have left this one in the \" missed \" category . xxmaj logan xxmaj xxunk xxunk / xxunk,xxbos yes it 's xxmaj zakk . yes it 's a masterpiece . why ? well , where does one start ? xxmaj zakk xxmaj wylde decided that his xxmaj ozzy xxmaj days were n't really what he was about . undoubtedly he owes his rock and roll life to the xxmaj xxunk , but he felt there was something more to share with the world . this is what he put forth . a true master work from a man who may be the rock and roll high priest of our generation . everthing that is great about rock is found within : blues , country , a little bit of soulful harmony and good old fashioned heavy metal will grace your eardrums on this gem . why try to describe each tune , when you can let the music do the talking . i bought this baby the day it was released , and have never had a single week go by when i did n't hear a track from it , be it from a mix cd , or the cd itself . do yourself a huge favor and pick it up while you 're on here . too much talk can spoil the surprise . just trust me and spin it for yourself . peace .,xxbos i was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film . xxmaj if you sit close to the screen , you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures . xxmaj the detail , colors , and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than xxmaj toy xxmaj story . xxmaj how they were able to pull off the shading , i will never know . i do hope that xxup pixar will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so i can find out how all this was accomplished . xxmaj based on this film , i think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film .,xxbos xxmaj pretty good service for fast food .,xxbos xxmaj works great .\n",
